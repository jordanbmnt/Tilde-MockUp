Tilde Mockups (537)
For raw project instructions see: http://syllabus.africacode.net/projects/tilde-mockups/

## Objective:
- I plan on updating the entire UI of Tilde. 
  - This includes theme, menu, and added functions.
- I have decided to add two buttons inside of the menu that I think is necessary when accessing Tilde. These buttons are:
  -  Hesk Desk
  - Umuzi Home
- I have also removed the Dashboard section because I feel like it was not necessary for the mockup.
